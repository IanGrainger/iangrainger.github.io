      <p>I love typescript. It helps you to avoid typos, and ensures you don’t pass properties into the wrong functions, as well as helping expose possible issues with nulls. It’s amazing, and i want to spend all my time writing it.</p>
  
  <p>The only problem with typescript is that it is a <em>lot</em>. You need your tsconfig and you need the module settings right to allow top level await, as well as the step to actually convert your typescript code to javascript.</p>
  
  <h2 id="the-alternative">The alternative</h2>
  
  <p>I had forgotten than VSCode does quite a lot for you even without typescript. It will infer types in just the same way as typescript - the difference is you can’t help it with explicit type declarations.</p>
  
  <p>But it turns out that isn’t true! I didn’t realise until <a href="https://twitter.com/Rich_Harris/status/1350436286948122625">this drama</a> in the javascript framework world that with <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/jsdoc-supported-types.html">JSDoc</a>, it turns you you still can!</p>
  
  <h2 id="an-easier-way-to-hack">An easier way to hack</h2>
  
  <p>Creating a new typescript project to hack some code and explore a problem space was such a hassle I wrote a <a href="/blog/2023/01/28/ts-node-playground.html">blog post</a> about it. But now, I can just create a new javascript file, and start hacking away. If I want to add type info, I can start adding a JSDoc comments.</p>
