<h1>The Nightcasts</h1>
<p>
  At night time Amye's friends come, and umulo comes too - and they have an
  awesome car they made at christmas - the car has 3 car bits: 1 for 3 people to
  sit in, one on the back on the left which is the alicorn room, and the third
  is for the animals, and there's a box for umulo, it also has a rainbow on the
  car bit.
</p>
<p>
  It was the best day, but the worst night, because the Dark Dragons were out at
  night and stealing all of the child's dreams.
</p>
<p>
  But when Amye saw them, she sort of recognised them, and she said: "Bluey One?
  Bluey One?" because she actually found an egg, and one of the Dark Dragons
  came out of it and she'd lost it. and she'd named it Bluey One, and then
  changed the name later to blacky one.
</p>
<p>
  And then Amye jumped onto the Dark Dragon and they went to stop the other
  dragons.
</p>
<p>
  But there were really strong winds, and it pushed them towards the other
  dragons, and they crahsed onto the ground and they didn't take any more dreams
  because they were dead - but Bluey One was the only one still alive.
</p>
<p>
  And after that they went back home but there was still a problem: All their
  Christmas and Halloween costumes had gone!
</p>
<p>
  But it was all just a dream because Amye was having a dream during her daytime
  nap! But Bluey One was still there.
